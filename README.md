# PAL
PAL is for the disenfranchised and disempowered. PAL will make small life choices for you in the hope that the resources PAL provides will help you to empower yourself. Once PAL has made the decision for you he will provide you with a resource (selected at random) related to personal accountability/empowerment.

I want PAL to represent nihilism so that PAL can embody and displace the user's nihilism and help them to focus on empowering themselves.

## Strategy
PAL is intended to empower by temporarily displacing personal accountability and providing resources to those who need to redirect their potential.

## Scope
PAL will allow the users to indulge in a chance-based evaluation of their potential failure or success at a task submitted by the user. PAL is therefore an arbitrary guidance counsellor.

## Structure
PAL is the first and only element you can interact with on the site. He will then provide third party resources to enable the user to re-approach decision-making for themselves.

## Skeleton
PAL will appear centrally on the homepage but there will be a resources page and about section on the site to explain the philosophy of PAL and also a disclaimer recommending against using PAL for serious personal use.
